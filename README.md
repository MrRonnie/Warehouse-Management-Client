### Project Details

To build this project we used React,which is a JavaScript Library and bootstrap for styling. We also implemented react router here so the pages of the site loads faster than the regular websites.We used firebase authentication system and private route.For backend used node js and express as a framework.
And lastly for storing data we used mongodb which is a NoSql database management.
